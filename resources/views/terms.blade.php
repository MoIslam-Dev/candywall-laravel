This page serves to inform visitors about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for those who choose to use our Service.<br>&nbsp;<br>

By opting to use our Service, you agree to the collection and utilization of information as outlined in this policy. The Personal Information gathered is intended for the improvement and provision of the Service, and we commit not to share or utilize your information in ways other than specified in this Privacy Policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>

The terms used herein align with those defined in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at CandyWall, unless explicitly defined differently in this Privacy Policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>

To enhance your experience while using our Service, we may request specific personally identifiable information, including but not limited to handset model and fingerprint. The information collected will be retained and utilized as described in this privacy policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>

The app may employ third-party services that collect information for identification purposes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Log Data</h5>

Whenever you use our Service, in the event of an app error, we collect data and information (via third-party products) on your phone, referred to as Log Data. This may encompass details such as your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration during Service use, timestamp of usage, and other statistics.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Cookies</h5>

Cookies, small data files commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers, are not explicitly used by this Service. However, third-party code and libraries within the app may use “cookies” for information collection and service enhancement. You have the choice to accept or reject these cookies, understanding that refusing them may limit certain Service features.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Service Providers</h5>

Third-party companies and individuals may be engaged for reasons such as facilitating the Service, providing it on our behalf, performing Service-related tasks, or assisting in the analysis of Service usage. These third parties have access to your Personal Information solely for the tasks assigned to them on our behalf, with an obligation not to disclose or use the information for other purposes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Security</h5>

While striving to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, it's important to note that no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and users are encouraged to be mindful of this.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>

The Service may include links to external sites. Clicking on a third-party link redirects you to a site not operated by us. It is strongly recommended to review the Privacy Policy of these external websites, as we have no control over or responsibility for their content, privacy policies, or practices.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h5>Children’s Privacy</h5>

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children in this age group. If such information is inadvertently provided, we promptly delete it upon discovery. Parents or guardians who are aware of their child providing us with personal information are encouraged to contact us for necessary actions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
