<h4>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h4><br>

<h4>Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>

We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Application to customize and enhance your experience. Your personal information is not collected through these technologies when you access the Application. While most browsers accept cookies by default, removing or rejecting cookies may affect the availability and functionality of the Application. Web beacons cannot be declined, but they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or adjusting your browser’s settings to notify you each time a cookie is offered, allowing you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>Internet-Based Advertising</h4>

We may use third-party software for serving ads on the Application, managing email marketing campaigns, and handling other interactive marketing initiatives. This software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to manage and optimize your online experience with us. For more details on opting out of interest-based ads, visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>Website Analytics</h4>

We may partner with selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to implement tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Application. This allows for the analysis of users’ use of the Application, determination of content popularity, and better understanding of online activity. By accessing the Application, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. Review their privacy policies and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors.<br>&nbsp;<br>

Be aware that obtaining a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing browser, or altering your browser’s cookie files may clear certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or settings.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h4>

The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications, including advertisements and external services, not affiliated with us. Once you leave the Application via these links, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before providing any information to third-party websites, familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of the responsible third party. Take necessary steps, at your discretion, to protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of third parties, including other linked sites, services, or applications.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

We employ administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. Despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security when you provide personal information.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h4>

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the provided contact information below.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>

Most web browsers, some mobile operating systems, and our mobile application include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting. Activating this signals your privacy preference against having data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. As of now, we do not respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h4><br>

<h4>Account Information</h4>

You may review, change, or terminate the information in your account at any time by:<br>

* Logging into your account settings and updating your account details.
* Contacting us using the provided contact information.<br>&nbsp;<br>

Upon requesting to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files for fraud prevention, troubleshooting, assisting investigations, enforcing our Terms of Use, and/or complying with legal requirements.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h4>Emails and Communications</h4>

If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from us, you may opt-out by:<br>

    Specifying your preferences during your account registration.
    Logging into your account settings to update your preferences.
